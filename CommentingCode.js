/** * <p>Be generous with comments. It is useful to leave information that will be read at a later time by people (possibly yourself) who will need to understand what you have done. The comments should be well-written and clear, just like the code they are annotating. An occasional nugget of humor is appreciated, but cynical and resentful comments are not. </p> * * <p>You do not need to write comments that describe what is easy to see in the code. Since your code should be clear, concise and well-written, additional comments describing what the code is doing are not necessary. Instead, leave comments to provide additional information and focus on the WHY. For example, WHY is the code doing what it is doing? WHY was a certain choice made? Or WHERE can additional information be found? </p> * * <p>If you use a workaround or hack, denote that with a “ //HACK: ” and then explain why that code was hacked or a workaround was used.</p> * * <p>If something is not complete, or has to be changed down the road, denote that with “ //TODO: “ and then explain what is still needed.</p> * * <p>Make comments meaningful. Focus on what is not immediately obvious.</p> * * <p>It is important that comments be kept up-to-date. Erroneous comments can make programs even harder to read and understand.</p> * * <p>Use block comments and follow <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/" target="_blank">JSDoc 3 Tag Dictionary</a></p> * * * @example * // Some JSDoc 3 Tags. * // @author <name> [<emailAddress>] * // @copyright <some copyright text> * // @desc <some description> * // @param {string} * // @param {array} * // @param {object} * // @class <SomeClassName> * // @classdesc <some description> * * * * */// Use camelCase for naming varibale names.var CommentingCode = "Working With Comments";
