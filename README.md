Front-end Code Standards
================
Simple documentation, conventions and code standards for front-end development.

1. Install jsdocs via npm: sudo npm install jsdoc

2. cd into the project: cd path/to/frontend-code-standards

3. Generate HTML files: jsdoc *.js

4. If you would like to use the template (coherent) that I am currently customizing do the following: jsdoc *.js -t templates/coherent
