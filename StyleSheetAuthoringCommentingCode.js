/** * <p>Be generous with comments. It is useful to leave information that will be read at a later time by people (possibly yourself) who will need to understand what you have done. The comments should be well-written and clear, just like the code they are annotating. An occasional nugget of humor might be appreciated. Frustrations and resentments will not.</p> * * <p>Sass supports standard multiline CSS comments, as well as single-line comments. The multiline comments are preserved in the CSS output where possible, while the single-line comments are removed.</p> * * <p>Make comments meaningful. Focus on what is not immediately visible.</p> * * * @example * // These comments are only one line long each. * // They won't appear in the CSS output, * // since they use the single-line comment syntax. * a { color: green; }. * * // Use single comments that you want to keep in source files but do not want to appear in production stylesheets * // For all other comments use multiline * */// Use camelCase for naming varibale names.var StyleSheetAuthoringCommenting = "Style Sheet Authoring Commenting";
