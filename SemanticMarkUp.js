/**
 * <p>With the increased emphasis on semantics and structure in HTML 5 it is important to consider the following when marking up your web and or web application pages:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Metadata: Content that sets up presentation or behavior of the content</li>
 *     <li>Embedding: Any content that imports or resources into the document. Those elements are as follows: audio, canvas, embed, iframe, img, math, object, svg, and video</li>
 *     <li>Interactive: Any content specifically intended for interaction. Those elements are as follows: a, audio, button, details, embed, iframe, img, input, keygen, label, menu, object, select,
 * textarea and video</li>
 *     <li>Heading: Defines the header of a section which can either be explicitly marked up with sectioning elements or implied by the heading content itself. Those elements are as followed: h1-h6 and hgroup.</li>
 *     <li>Phrasing: The text of the document, as well as elements used to markup the text within the paragraph level structures. Those elements are as followed: a, abbr, audio, b, bdo, br, button, canvas,
 cite, code, command, datalist, del, dfn, em, embed, i, iframe, img, input, ins, kbd, keygen, label, link, map, mark, math, meta, meter, noscript, object, output, progress, q, ruby, amp, script, select, small,, span, strong, sub, sup, svg, textarea, time, var, video and wbr.</li>
 *     <li>Flow: Majority of elements that would be included in the normal flow of a document. Those elements are as followed: a, abbr, address, article, aside, audio, b, blockquote, bdo, br, button, canvas, cite, code, command, datalist, details, div, dl, del, dfn, em, embed, fieldset, figure, footer, form, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, header, hgroup, hr,  i, iframe, img, input, ins, kbd, keygen, label, link, map, mark, math, meta, meter, noscript, object, output, p, pre, progress, q, ruby, amp, section, script, select, small,, span, strong, sub, sup, svg, table, textarea, time, var, video and wbr.</li>
 *     <li>Sectioning: Content that defines the scope of headings and footers. Those elements are as followed: article, aside, nav and section</li>
 *     <li>HTML 5 is concerned with the structure of the document not the presentation. The display of elements is left entirely to the user agent and the CSS employed.</li>
 *     <li>Whatâ€™s the role of div tags? Previously div tags where widely used to mark up semantics into common to a group of consecutive elements. With all the new tags for structuring content in HTML 5, div tags should be used when the HTML 5 tags are not appropriate. Div tags are still the best choice for adding structure. Always make sure semantic tags are appropriate.</li>
 *     <li>Only use section and article tags when sectioning content is appropriate. Every time you use a section or article tag you create a new title element in your outline. If the section you are creating doesn't warrant this level of specificity consider using a div.</li>
 *     <li>Only use the aside tag for related content</li>
 *     <li>Headers and footers are for grouping heading or footer content</li>
 *     <li>Nav tags should not be used for every navigation grouping</li>
 *     <li>Divs can used to group related content</li>
 *     <li>Outlining</li>
 * </ul>
